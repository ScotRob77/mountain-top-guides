                Hi, I'm Robbie and I've been running Mountain Top Guides
                for the past 10 years. I am a fully qualified British Mountain Guide and I
                have climbed all over the world. I have been climbing the Scottish Hills since
                I was 5 and bagged my first Munro at the age of 7. I have since climbed in every
                continent. I worked in the Alps for 10 years before moving back to Scotland 11
                years ago. My greatest achievement was reaching the summit of Everest in 2015.

                Hi, I'm Lexi and I've been working at Mountain Top Guides for 5 years.
                I have been working in the outdoor industry for many years. I was a rock
                climbing instructor in California for 6years before moving to Dubai to 
                become a watersports instructor. Although it was great fun out there I
                wa missing home, so I returned to the UK to become a qualified Mountain
                guide. I passed my WMCI back in 2016 and joined Mountain Top Guides in 2017.
                If I'm not venturing out into the hills of the UK you will find me splashing
                about somewhere off the wonderful west coast of Scotland.
