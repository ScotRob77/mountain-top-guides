        <div id="him-text">Hi, I'm David and I've been running Mountain Top Guides for the past 10 years. I am a fully qualified British Mountain Guide and I have climbed all over the world. I have been climbing the Scottish Hills since I was 5 and bagged my first Munro at the age of 7. I have since climbed in every continent. I worked in the Alps for 10 years before moving back to Scotland 11 years ago. My greatest achievement was reaching the summit of Everest in 2015.</div>
