                Test yourself against the wild of winter with our winter mountain guiding
                trips. Running from December to March this is mostly based in the
                Highlands of Scotland where temperatures can reach -15 and winds pick
                up to over 100mph. This is not for the feint hearted and a good level of
                fitness is required. A full kit list of what is needed can be sent on request.

                If you are an experienced hill walker in winter and want to take your
                outdoor adventures to the next level then join us on one of our winter
                mountaineering courses. We will take you to some of Scotland's most
                famous winter climbing venues and give you the opportunity to climb
                on routes up to Grade III. A good level of fitness is essential. Experience
                using an ice axe and crampons is beneficial to get the most out of the
                course. This is done over 2 days.
