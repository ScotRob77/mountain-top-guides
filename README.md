# Mountain Top Guides
This website is targeted towards people who want to adventure into the mountains of the UK during summer and winter but maybe don't have the confidence or skillset to do it in a safe and responsible manner.
It is aimed at the beginner and more advanced hill walker. It also offers customers the opportunity to try winter climbing. The site will be useful for walkers to realise they don't need to have knowledge in mountain saftey to enjoy the wilder parts of Britain, as the guide will keep them safe at all times.

# Typography and color scheme
* I want fonts that are clear and easy to read so used Roboto for headings and Nunito for main text from [Google Fonts](https://www.Fonts.google.com)
* I wanted a clear, clean color scheme so opted for blue background with a white text.

# Testing
* I tested that this page works on Chrome and Edge.
* I confirmed that this project is responsive and works on all screen sizes using the dev tools available on Chrome and Edge.
* I confirmed that all text is readable and easy to understand.
* I confirmed that all internal links work as they should.
* I have confirmed that the Want to join form works: that it requires an entry in each field; will only accept a proper email format in the email field; and the submit button takes you to a thank you page.

# Bugs
### Solved Bugs
* When I deployed to Github pages and validated there were errors in my nav list. There were two closing li tags. This was resolved by deleting one.
* The background colour also didn't contrast well enough with some of the text. I changed the background colour to a darker blue and removed the dark blue text for white.

### Unresolved Bugs
* On smaller screens (under 430px) the nav bar goes onto two lines with the first two pages going onto the second line which would be better if they were on the top line. The links still work but is not aeshetically the best

# Validator Testing
### HTML
* No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
### CSS
* No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator
### Accessibility
* I confirmed that the colours and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse in devtools
